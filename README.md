# ClarkeLib
An open library for [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) that enables calculation of basic space elevator parameters and loads.

How to use it?
--------------

Access [cloud-based version of SageMath](https://cloud.sagemath.com/) and create an account if you still don't have one. Create new project and upload *clarkelib.sage* and *clarkelib-test.sagews* from the repository. Open the last file, which is essentially an example of the ClarkeLib use case, and get familiar with its structure. Create a new worksheet and run your own analysis of a space elevator.
